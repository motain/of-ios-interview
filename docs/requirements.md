# Goal 

The goal for this pairing session is to create an app that can determine the winner of an election. The name of each candidate counts as one vote, and names are separated by white spaces. We need an app that, given the list of votes, determines the top three most voted candidates - we don't care about the name, only about the voting count for now

# First Step - Figuring out the algorithm

The idea here is to create a component that will solve the algorithmic problem

# Second step - Displaying the results on the screen

Here we will be using any UI technology of your choice to display the results to the user

# Third step - Fetching the election results from an API

Here we will fetch the election results from a service component which is already implemented at [Sources/ElectionResultService.swift](../ElectionCounter/Sources/ElectionResultService.swift)

No one is expected to complete all three, they are mostly general directions that we can work on during the interview.
